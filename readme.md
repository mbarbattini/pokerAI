# Poker Simulator #

This project is capable of playing Texas Holdem' for up to 23 players. It can automatically play single games which include
1. Initial draw
2. Flop
3. Card 4
4. Card 5
and it can then determine the player that wins the game. It can also deal with ties between players that have the same hand including the respective tiebreaker for that hand. Additional functionality includes a simulation of a large number of games that can give statistics on the frequency of rare hands, such as a straight flush or a royal flush. Initial benchmarking has found that 2,000,000 games with 8 players can be completed in ~2 minutes.
